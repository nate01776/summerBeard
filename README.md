# SUMMERBEARD

## DESCRIPTION
SPA with content stored on a single markdown file for ease of maintenance. The app was built for a Boston based band leading up to their initial EP release in Spring 2017. 

The app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and is hosted on Netlify. 

The project will fork to be a template for other bands or users who currently only have facebook/bandcamp pages to quickly host their own page at only the cost of the domain.

## FEATURES
* Single page React app.
* Responsive design works across all screen sizes.
* Show and post data is pulled from Facebook's Graph API and rendered to tables.
* Lyrics are stored in a JSON file on the hosting server.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
* ReactJS
