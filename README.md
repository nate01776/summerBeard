##DESCRIPTION
Single page React app with heavy Facebook API integration for all content. The app was built for a local Boston based band leading up to their initial EP release in Spring 2017. The app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and is hosted on Netlify. This site is the test-bed for a React template that is in the works to allow bands currently only on bandcamp or Facebook to get sites up and running with just an App ID, secret and band user ID.

##FEATURES
